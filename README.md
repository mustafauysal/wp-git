# WP-Git


Requires at least: 4.5


## Origin Story
A few years ago my colleague [@s](https://github.com/s) and I wanted to build WordPress theme which looks like Github. We planned as  weekend project but it took more than 2+ years. (Apology folks)

## Warnings
- This theme shows post revisions publicly, be careful.
